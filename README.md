## 📖 What This Project Is About

Hi! This is my college project where I'm building a **Student Attendance Management System** using mobile apps. The idea came from seeing how attendance is still tracked manually in our college using paper registers. I thought, why not make it digital?

### The Main Idea 💡

Create **two mobile apps**:
- **One for teachers** - to mark attendance easily from their phones
- **One for students** - to check their attendance anytime

Both apps connect to the same database, so everything stays in sync!

---

## 🎯 What Problem Am I Solving?

In our college, I noticed these issues:
- Teachers waste time calling out roll numbers
- Students don't know their attendance until results
- Paper registers can get lost or damaged
- Difficult to calculate attendance percentage
- No way to track attendance history

**My solution**: Make everything digital with mobile apps!

## 📱 What I'm Building

### Faculty App (For Teachers)
Teachers can:
- Login with their ID and password
- Pick a date from calendar
- Select their subject (Physics, Maths, etc.)
- Mark students as Present/Absent with simple toggles
- Students get automatically loaded from database
- Submit and done! Attendance saved

**Special feature**: Teachers have 3 days to edit if they made a mistake. After that, it locks automatically.

### Student App (For Students) 
Students can:
- Login with enrollment number
- See overall attendance percentage
- View calendar with color indicators:
  - 🟢 Green dates = Present
  - 🔴 Red dates = Absent
- Click any date to see which subject it was
- Get alerts if attendance drops below 75%

**Important**: Students can only VIEW, they cannot edit anything!

## 🛠️ Technologies I'm Learning

This project is helping me learn:

**Frontend (Mobile Apps)**
- React Native - for building mobile apps
- Expo - makes development easier
- JavaScript - programming language

**Backend (Server)**
- Supabase - handles database and user login
- PostgreSQL - stores all the data
- Row Level Security - keeps data safe

---

## 🗄️ Database I Designed

I created these tables in my database:

```
teachers table
├── teacher_id
├── name
├── email
└── faculty_id

students table
├── student_id
├── enrollment_number
├── name
├── semester
└── is_active

subjects table
├── subject_id
├── subject_name
├── semester
└── assigned_faculty

attendance table
├── attendance_id
├── student_id
├── subject_id
├── date
├── status (Present/Absent)
└── is_locked (auto-locks after 3 days)
```

---

## 🔐 Security Features

I'm implementing these security measures:
- Only teachers can mark attendance
- Only students can view their OWN attendance
- Students cannot see other students' data
- Teachers can only access their assigned subjects
- Auto-lock prevents editing old attendance
- Database-level security (Row Level Security)

---

## 📊 System Architecture

The system has 4 layers:
1. **Apps Layer** - Faculty App & Student App
2. **Authentication** - Login with Supabase
3. **Security** - Row Level Security checks
4. **Database** - PostgreSQL stores everything
